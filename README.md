# adk-spreadsheet-agent

## Project Vision

spreadsheet-agent aims to build a multi-agent AI system that empowers users to interact conversationally with two specific spreadsheets of our choosing. Leveraging the google-adk library, this project will enable natural language chat with spreadsheet data, making complex data exploration and manipulation accessible through dialogue.

## Key Goals

- **Conversational AI for Spreadsheets:** Users will be able to chat with the agent to query, analyze, and interact with spreadsheet data.
- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** The system will support multiple agents, allowing for collaborative or specialized interactions with the data.
- **Integration with Google-ADK:** We will use the google-adk library as the foundation for building intelligent, context-aware agents.
- **Automated Environment Setup:** At the root of the project, a `scripts/` directory will contain an initial script (e.g., `run_*.py`) that, when executed, will set up the local environment by importing two designated spreadsheets into a SQLite database for use by the agent.

## Project Intent

Our goal is to create an intuitive, extensible platform for AI-driven spreadsheet interaction, lowering the barrier for users to gain insights and automate tasks with their data. This project is in its early stages, and we welcome contributions and feedback as we develop its core features.
